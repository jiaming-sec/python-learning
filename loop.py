# Python has two primitive loop
# while loops
# for loops

# while loop
# with "while" loop, we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true
# print i as long as i is less than 6
i = 1
while i < 6:
  print("i")
  i += 1

# the "break" statement
# with "break" statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
i = 1 
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  f i ==3:
    break
  i +=1
