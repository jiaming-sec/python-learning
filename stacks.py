# A stack is a data structure that can hold many elements.
# when removing a pancake, it will always be the last pancake you added. This way of organizing elements is called LIFO: Last In First Out.

Push: Adds a new element on the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
Peek: Returns the top element on the stack.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Size: Finds the number of elements in the stack.

#Stacks can be implemented by using arrays or linked lists.
# Stacks can be used to implement undo mechanisms, to revert to previous states, to create algorithms for depth-first search in graphs, or for backtracking.
