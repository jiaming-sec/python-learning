# Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, Python "lists" can be used instead
# To work with arrays in Python, have to import a library, like the "Numpy" library

my_array = [7,12,9,4,11]
print(my_array[0])

# find the lowest value in an Array
# 1. create a variable 'minVal' and set it equal to the first value of the array
# 2. go through every element in the array
# 3. if the current element has a lower value than minVal, update minVal to this value
